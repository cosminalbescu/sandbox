## Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) for Git Testing

### Introduction

To ensure the reliability, consistency, and automation of the tests, we need a well-structured Continuous Integration (CI) system. This section outlines the setup and requirements for running the tests in an automated manner.

## CI/CD Requirements

### 1. **Infrastructure Requirements**
- A Linux-based CI/CD runner (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS recommended).
- Stable connection with at least 100 Mbps bandwidth.
- Pre-installed software:
  - Git
  - Python (latest stable version)
  - `pytest`
  - `subprocess` module support
  - SSH client for secure authentication

---

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline Structure**

1. **Deployment Options**
   - **Jenkins**: Self-hosted CI/CD server that allows flexible pipeline scripting.
   - **GitHub Actions**: Native GitHub automation for running workflows on push or PR.
   - **Cloud-based Solutions (AWS/Azure)**: Leveraging managed CI/CD pipelines like AWS CodeBuild, Azure DevOps.
   - **Dockerization**: Running tests inside Docker containers to ensure consistent environments.

2. **Example: Dockerized Jenkins CI/CD Setup**
   - **Install Docker & Start Jenkins in a Container:**
   - **Run Jenkins as a Docker Container:**
   - **Install Required Jenkins Plugins:**
     - Git Plugin
     - Pipeline Plugin
     - Docker Pipeline Plugin
   - **Configure Jenkins Pipeline:**
     - Create a `Jenkinsfile`:
       ```groovy
       pipeline {
           agent any
           stages {
               stage('Checkout') {
                   steps {
                       git 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
                   }
               }
               stage('Build & Test') {
                   steps {
                       sh 'docker build -t git-test .'
                       sh 'docker run git-test pytest tests/'
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Run Jenkins Pipeline:**
     - Open `http://localhost:8080`, configure Jenkins, create a new pipeline, and set the repository.
     - Trigger the pipeline to run tests inside Docker.

3. **Trigger Mechanism**
   - **On Push & Pull Requests**: Runs on every `push` and `pull request` to the main branch.
   - **Nightly Performance Runs**: Executes full performance tests (e.g., `test_08_git_performance.py`) every night to detect potential performance regressions.
   - **Daily Functional Runs**: Runs core test suites (`test_01_git.py`, `test_02_git_workflow.py`, etc.) every 24 hours to ensure consistent behavior.
   - **Acceptance Testing Runs**: Executes a predefined set of critical tests before a major release or deployment.
   - **On-Demand Execution**: Developers or testers can manually trigger the test pipeline when necessary for debugging or validation.
   - **Scheduled Security Audits**: Periodic execution of security-related tests (`test_07_git_security.py`) to detect vulnerabilities.

4. **Stages**
   - **Setup Environment:** Install dependencies and configure test environment.
   - **Run Basic Git Tests:** Execute `test_01_git.py`, `test_02_git_workflow.py`, and `test_03_git_cleanup.py`.
   - **Run Advanced Git Tests:** Execute `test_04_git_advanced.py`, `test_05_git_concurrent.py`, `test_06_git_network.py`, `test_07_git_security.py`.
   - **Run Performance Tests:** Execute `test_08_git_performance.py`.
   - **Post-Test Cleanup:** Ensure repository state is reset.

5. **Artifacts & Reporting**
   - Test results will be stored as CI/CD artifacts for 30 days or 100 builds (to avoid unnecessary space usage).
   - Logs and performance metrics will be archived for further analysis.

6. **Docker Cleanup**
   - To avoid unused containers consuming system resources, a cleanup step is recommended:
     ```sh
     docker system prune -af
     ```
   - This ensures that old images, stopped containers, and unused volumes are removed after test execution.

---

### 3. **Security Considerations**
- Use **SSH keys** for secure authentication.
- Enforce **signed commits** for sensitive branches.
- Implement **access control policies** to prevent unauthorized actions.

---

### 4. **Scalability & Optimization**
- Parallelize test execution to reduce runtime.
- Use caching for dependency installation.
- Implement scheduled test runs (e.g., nightly builds) to catch regressions early.
